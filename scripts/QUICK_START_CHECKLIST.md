# ✅ Quick Start Checklist - Simplified Product Carousel System

Follow these simple steps to set up the product carousel system.

---

## 📋 Pre-requisites

- [ ] Supabase account with storage bucket set up
- [ ] Product images ready to upload
- [ ] Node.js installed

---

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Database Setup (2 minutes)

- [ ] Open Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Go to SQL Editor
- [ ] Create the topics table:

```sql
-- Topics table for product carousels
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS topics_upskin_products (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  used BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Add some sample topics
INSERT INTO topics_upskin_products (title) VALUES
  ('Things I will never put on my face again after 6 years as an esthetician...'),
  ('Rating all my products from 1/10'),
  ('My honest opinion on VIRAL skincare products'),
  ('Products that SAVED my sensitive skin'),
  ('Expensive products that were worth it vs total waste of money');
```

---

### Step 2: Upload Product Images (10 minutes)

- [ ] Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
- [ ] Navigate to bucket: `files`
- [ ] Create folder: `upskin_products` (exact name, case-sensitive)
- [ ] Upload product images (JPG, PNG, WebP)
  - Recommended: Clear product packaging photos
  - Minimum: 10-20 products for good variety
  - Ideal: 50+ products for maximum variety

**Naming tip:** Any naming works, but descriptive names help:
- `cerave-moisturizing-cream.jpg`
- `the-ordinary-niacinamide.jpg`
- `skii-facial-treatment-essence.jpg`

---

### Step 3: Upload First Page Images (5 minutes)

- [ ] In the same `files` bucket
- [ ] Create folder: `upskin_firstpage_beauty`
- [ ] Upload first page/title screen images
  - These appear as the first slide in carousels
  - Typically beauty/skincare themed backgrounds

---

### Step 4: Environment Variables (2 minutes)

- [ ] Open `.env.local` in your project root
- [ ] Verify these variables exist:

```bash
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJxxx...
```

- [ ] Save the file

---

### Step 5: Test the System (5 minutes)

- [ ] Start your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

- [ ] Open browser: `http://localhost:3000/products`
- [ ] Click "Generate" button
- [ ] Watch the carousel generation:
  - ✅ Random topic is selected
  - ✅ 4 random products are selected
  - ✅ AI analyzes products and generates reviews
  - ✅ Carousel displays with ratings and bullet points

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You've successfully set up the system if:

✅ Products folder has images uploaded
✅ First page folder has background images
✅ Topics table has topics in database
✅ Carousel generation works end-to-end
✅ Each product gets AI-generated review with rating and bullet points

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Simple Random Selection
- **No tagging required** - Just upload product images
- **No complex matching** - Products are randomly selected
- **AI analyzes everything** - Product name, rating, and review points are generated by AI vision

### Topic Examples
The system works best with general, engaging topics:
- ✅ "Things I will never put on my face again..."
- ✅ "Rating all my products from 1/10"
- ✅ "My honest opinion on VIRAL skincare products"
- ✅ "Products that broke me out vs saved my skin"

---

## 🔄 Adding More Content

### Add More Products
- [ ] Upload new images to `upskin_products` folder
- [ ] They'll automatically be included in random selection
- [ ] No additional setup needed!

### Add More Topics
- [ ] Add rows to `topics_upskin_products` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO topics_upskin_products (title) VALUES
  ('Your new topic here');
```

### Add More First Page Images
- [ ] Upload to `upskin_firstpage_beauty` folder
- [ ] System will randomly select one for each carousel

---

## 🌍 Spanish Version

The Spanish version works identically:
- [ ] Visit: `http://localhost:3000/products-es`
- [ ] Uses same product images
- [ ] Uses same topics (AI translates to Spanish)
- [ ] Generates Spanish reviews automatically

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### No products showing
**Check:**
```
- Folder name is exactly: upskin_products (case-sensitive)
- Images are in: files/upskin_products/
- Files are: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .gif
```

### Generation fails
**Check browser console and terminal logs:**
- Topic fetch failed? → Check `topics_upskin_products` table exists
- First image failed? → Check `upskin_firstpage_beauty` folder exists
- Product images failed? → Check `upskin_products` folder has images
- AI generation failed? → Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is set

### Products don't match topic
**This is expected!** The system uses random selection. The AI will:
- Analyze each product independently
- Generate appropriate ratings based on the topic
- Mix positive and negative reviews to match the narrative

---

## ✨ Tips for Best Results

1. **Product Image Quality**
   - Use clear photos showing product packaging
   - Brand name and product name should be readable
   - Avoid blurry or low-res images

2. **Product Variety**
   - Mix of affordable and luxury products
   - Different product types (cleanser, serum, moisturizer, etc.)
   - Various brands and categories

3. **Topic Crafting**
   - General topics work best: "Rating all my products"
   - Narrative topics are engaging: "What worked vs what didn't"
   - Avoid overly specific: ~~"CeraVe moisturizer for winter"~~

4. **Maintenance**
   - Add new products regularly for variety
   - Add new topics to keep content fresh
   - Check console logs if something breaks
